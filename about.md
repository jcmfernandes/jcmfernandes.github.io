## I'm a software engineer from Lisbon, Portugal.

I have a masters degree in software engineering from [TU Lisbon](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt) and a strong passion for technology. I nurture a deep care for my craft and I'm always seeking new ways improve my art.

-- Randy Pausch

I already played lots of different roles in the industry. Project manager? Check. Safety critical systems researcher? Check. Kernel developer? Check. Web developer? Check. Embedded systems developer? Check. Novelty thrills me. I'm now developing cloud-based call center software at [Talkdesk](http://www.talkdesk.com), together with a truly awesome team.
