I'm an expert in fast-growing SaaS companies. I've helped build multiple solid engineering teams from 4 to over 100 engineers, scaled businesses to dozens of millions of dollars in ARR. I design and implement predictable and reliable systems.

I have vast experience in contemporary technologies such as Ruby, Rails, Java, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, ZooKeeper, gRPC, GraphQL, Avro, Protocol Buffers, Docker, Kubernetes. I'm keen on learning new things.
